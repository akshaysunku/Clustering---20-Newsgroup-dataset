It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \\npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\\none of the following:\\na) An employee of a government agency.\\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\n\\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\\n\\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\n\\n>And no, I\\'m not going to even think of buying one.

       " 'From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org\\nSubject: Space Advertising (1 of 2)\\nX-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993\\nLines: 81\\n\\nBrian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]\\n>And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN\\n>news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the \"wild\\n>idea\" stage or does it have real funding?\\n  \\n    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the\\nCommercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTISING\\n    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperating organization\\'s logos on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logos on its side of\\n   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GPS/Navstar program office\\n   This has not been considered \"paid advertising\" but rather\\n\"public relations\", since the restrictions have been such that only\\norganizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the\\nside, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting\\na 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras\\nis \"advertising\" as much as it is \"public relations\", in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has\\nrather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]\\n   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials\\nfor use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large\\nadvertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral serious studies in the early and mid 1980\\'s which looked at\\nputting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload\\nbay.  These ventures would be different than \"public relations\", in\\nthat the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms\\nparticipating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for\\nthe right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras\\nwould scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES\\n   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed\\nto pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,\\nSoviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from\\nparticipating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visiting cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch\\nvehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements\\non the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\'s upcoming movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Besides the usual logos of the participating\\norganizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\'s Conestoga rocket, its booster\\nrockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in\\nSpace News magazine a couple of months ago.\\n   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is\\ntalking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he\\ncreated with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising\\nsponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on\\nthe upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhis idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiving compensation.\"   This is being disputed, since the launch\\nis a \"commercial launch\" and NASA is receiving none of the\\nadvertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is\\ncoming from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARDS\"\\n   Orbital \"billboards\" have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein described another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".  Several\\ndifferent potential projects have been developed, although none have\\nbeen implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the \"Eiffel\\nII\" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in\\norbit to celebrate the French Republic\\'s Bi-centennial.\\n                                                (cont)\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n',\n",

I never would have expected him in the\\n#1 spot.\\n\\n>Gonzales, Rene       .685  ----  ----  ----  ----   0.685\\nIt\\'s no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first\\nand second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points\\nhigher in both leagues than any other year.\\n\\n>Leius, Scott         ----  ----  ----  .653  .680   0.672\\nLooks good.  Too bad he\\'s moving to short.\\n\\n>Pendleton, Terry     .692  .685  .631  .689  .634   0.667\\nHighest five-year regular, though he\\'s only had one year as good as Kevin\\nMitchell :->.\\n\\n>Ventura, Robin       ----  ----  .641  .647  .677   0.657\\n>Wallach, Tim         .728  .674  .600  .630  .665   0.657\\n>Gruber, Kelly        .717  .657  .580  .630  .664   0.650\\nThe other elite fielders in the league.\\n\\n>Pagliarulo, Mike     .631  ----  .575  .744  ----   0.649\\nThis is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.\\nHis 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of\\nthat may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the\\nPadres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and\\njudging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play\\nthird.\\n\\n>Williams, Matt       ----  ----  .633  .653  .656   0.647\\nAdd another to the elite fielders list.\\n\\n>Caminiti, Ken        ----  .675  .630  .653  .596   0.642\\n>Sabo, Chris          .751  .626  .616  .613  .575   0.642\\nToo fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don\\'t know\\nwhat happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low\\n1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988\\n(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.\\n\\n>Buechele, Steve      .647  .616  .647  .681  .599   0.635\\nStrange last two years.\\n\\n>Schmidt, Mike        .628  ----  ----  ----  ----   0.628\\nAccording to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.\\nBut at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).\\n\\n>Boggs, Wade          .643  .659  .550  .653  .634   0.626\\nBoggs has been pretty good.  I don\\'t know what happened in 1990, but every\\nother year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.\\n\\n>Martinez, Egdar      ----  ----  .621  .645  .599   0.624\\nLast year -- a fluke or a portent?\\n\\n>*NL Average*         .643  .625  .602  .623  .603   0.619\\n>Seitzer, Kevin       .654  .583  .593  ----  .635   0.616\\n>*AL Average*         .641  .612  .604  .620  .602   0.615\\nWhy is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close\\nto one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?\\n\\n>Jacoby, Brook        .624  .621  .600  ----  .597   0.613\\nBrook  is declining.\\n\\n>Hansen, Dave         ----  ----  ----  ----  .611   0.611\\n>Magadan, Dave        ----  ----  ----  ----  .609   0.609\\n>Jefferies, Greg      ----  ----  ----  ----  .606   0.606\\nThree first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I\\'m not sure why Jefferies\\ngets all the grief about his fielding.  He\\'s never had a good year, but while\\nat second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder\\nat third.\\n\\n>Zeile, Todd          ----  ----  ----  .614  .593   0.605\\nZeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he\\'s about\\n10 points below average.  And it\\'s probably not just the park, since Terry\\nPendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.\\n\\n>Baerga, Carlos       ----  ----  ----  .604  ----   0.604\\nMoving back to second was a good idea.\\n\\n>Hayes, Chris         ----  .601  .622  .606  .574   0.602\\nSo why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He\\'s had a grand total\\nof one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.\\n\\n>Johnson, Howard      .628  .549  .611  .573  ----   0.588\\n>Lansford, Carney     .620  .578  .594  ----  .550   0.587\\nHoward Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,\\nHoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn\\'t even break\\nthe .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.\\n\\n>Hollins, Dave        ----  ----  ----  ----  .577   0.577\\nGood hitter, but his fielding needs work.\\n\\n>Sheffield, Gary      ----  ----  .584  ----  .567   0.575\\nNot a good fielder.\\n\\n>Blauser, Jeff        ----  .573  ----  ----  ----   0.573\\n>Fryman, Travis       ----  ----  ----  .571  ----   0.571\\nBoth are better off at shortstop.\\n\\n>Gomez, Lee           ----  ----  ----  .551  .542   0.546\\nTwo consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn\\'t seem to\\nhave helped his fielding any.  \\n\\n>Palmer, Dean         ----  ----  ----  ----  .520   0.520\\nTexas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest\\nDA at third ever.

For\\ninstance, \\'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another\\nsimply to take pleasure in his suffering\\' might be thought of as a\\nplausible example.

The problem for the objectivist is to\\ndetermine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be\\nestablished.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what\\nis but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then\\nthey cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor\\ncan they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding\\ncontent;  \\'One ought always to do the right thing\\' is plainly true in\\nvirtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to\\naction (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may\\ntalk of \\'self-evident truths\\', but can he deny the subjectivist\\'s claim\\nthat self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left\\nof the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may\\nwell feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements\\nwith which he would wish to associate himself.

The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.

While there\\'s nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \\nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob\\'s (I know, some people can\\'t stand\\nhim and think he\\'s full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \\nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto\\'s are different, and that\\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \\nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \\nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Define \"armed better\". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\\n|> Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\\n|> faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\\n|> guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\\n|> in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to\\n|> 3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\\n|> like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\\n|> often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\\n|> \\n|> A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\\n|> \\n|> - A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\\n|>   the trigger again.\\n|> - A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n|>   but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n\\nYes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either\\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\\n\\n\\n|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n|>   to rotate to the next round.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\\nround - an advantage you don\\'t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it\\'s very rare, but your round will\\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\\non a misfire takes very little time.\\n\\n\\n|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n|>   easy motion, even one handed.\\n\\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\\nnecessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and\\nat the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the\\nround to set it off.\\n\\n|> - Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n|>   on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \\ntake more time.  You also don\\'t have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\\nstill be used if needed later).  \\n\\n|> \\n|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n|>   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n|>   lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n|>   about clearing it.\\n\\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\\n\\n\\n|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n|>   and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \\n|>   chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n|>   this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n|>   of employment as a revolver.\\n\\n|> - There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n|>   operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nAll common semi-auto\\'s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any\\nsafety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I\\'ve looked at.  For the DA semi\\'s it\\'s\\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there\\'s no real advantage\\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I\\'m\\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \\nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets\\nyou more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\\n|> switching many officers back to the old revolvers.

I still can\\'t figure out how it\\'s worse than a revolver\\nfor safety.  If you don\\'t pull the trigger it doesn\\'t go off.  I imagine that if all\\nyour revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger\\nfar enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that\\nnasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and\\nrelying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew\\noff your foot then you\\'d have problems when the hammer wasn\\'t there.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\\n|> the police don\\'t know nothing about firearms.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to:\\n       EnviroLeague\\n       P.O.

But\\neffectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy \\nof non-interference.

When work for a large program like\\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\\n   billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\\n   term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed\\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \\nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\n\\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does\\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!\\n\\nMy last point is that I can\\'t believe your claim that\\nCongress has never heard of the term \\'center tax.\\'\\nUnfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before\\nCongress isn\\'t on a computer, so I can\\'t do a simple\\nword search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely,\\nin some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods\\nwere documented for Congress?\\n',\n",

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\\n\\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse.

Deputy\\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\\n\\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\\n\\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\\n\\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\\nStriker, the Weaver\\'s yellow lab, started toward them barking\\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\\n\\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\\n\\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\\n\\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\\nand fired.  He didn\\'t bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\\nBill\\'s arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\\n\\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn\\'t you?\"  Nevin also\\npointed out that in last September\\'s testimony, Cooper had\\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\\ndecided that Thursday\\'s account was correct.  Nevin continued the\\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\\nhim [no answer was available].\\n\\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\\n\\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\\n\\nDrew\\n==============================================================\\n\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

Displaying all 256 levels\\nsynchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After\\nexperimenting with different aperture settings and screen\\nbrightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable\\ncontrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no\\nvisible contrast bands.\\n\\nTo minimize the exposure time the display program built 255\\ndifferent 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels\\nthat had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,\\netc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was\\nvery fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these\\nframes sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera\\nshutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote\\ndirectly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.\\n\\nOur biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the\\ntop left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took\\nan extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the\\nprocessors took the trouble to manually move the all images into\\nthe center of the print.

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!\\n\\n\\nDan Snodgrass\\nMedia Services\\nLewis & Clark College\\nPortland\\n',\n",

You still haven\\'t offered\\n\\nI\\'ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even\\ncontributed a few comments) but this stuff \"I\\'d rather face a knife than\\na gun\" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got \\'educated.\\'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don\\'t understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n\\'try their luck\\' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it\\'s only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it\\'s wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I\\'ve talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I\\'ve seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I\\'m old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I\\'ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the \\'fact\\' that hand gun \\'stopping\\' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to \\'take effect.\\'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn\\'t think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you\\'d better be planning on doing some dodging.

Where do they come \\n#from?  The question came from the idea that I heard that morals come from\\n#whatever is societally mandated.\\n\\nIt\\'s only one aspect of morality.  Societal morality is necessarily\\nvery crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what\\nis necessary to keep that society going  - and often it\\'s a little\\nover-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different\\nthing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble),\\nbut is stronger.  For example, some people are vegetarian, though eating\\nmeat may be perfectly legal.\\n\\n#\\n#>#Merely a question for the basis of morality\\n#>#\\n#>#Moral/Ethical behavior = _Societally_ _acceptable_ _behavior_.\\n#>#\\n#>#1)Who is society\\n#\\n#>Depends on the society.\\n#\\n#Doesn\\'t help.  Is the point irrelevant?\\n\\nNo.  Often the answer is \"we are\".  But if society is those who make\\nthe rules, that\\'s a different question.  If society is who should\\nmake the rules, that\\'s yet another.  I don\\'t claim to have the answers, either,\\nbut I don\\'t think we do it very well in Ireland, and I like some things\\nabout the US system, at least in principle.\\n\\n#\\n#>#2)How do \"they\" define what is acceptable?\\n#\\n#>Depends.\\n#On....  Again, this comes from a certain question (see above).\\n\\nWell, ideally they don\\'t, but if they must they should do it by consensus, IMO.\\n#\\n#>#3)How do we keep from a \"whatever is legal is what is \"moral\" \"position?\\n#\\n#>By adopting a default position that people\\'s moral decisions\\n#>are none of society\\'s business,\\n#\\n#So how can we put people in jail? How can we condemn other societies?\\n\\nBecause sometimes that\\'s necessary.  The hard trick is to recognise when\\nit is, and equally importantly, when it isn\\'t.\\n\\n# and only interfering when it\\'s truly\\n#>necessary.\\n#\\n#Why would it be necessary?  What right do we have to interfere?\\n\\nIMO, it isn\\'t often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various\\nkinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive \\nthe right to interfere is a difficult question - it\\'s a sort of\\nliar\\'s paradox: \"force is necessary for freedom\".   One possible justification\\nis that people who wish to take away freedom shouldn\\'t object if\\ntheir own freedom is taken away - the paradox doesn\\'t arise if\\nwe don\\'t actively wish to take way anyone\\'s freedom.\\n#\\n#  The introduction of permissible interference causes the problem\\n#>that it can be either too much or too little - but most people seem\\n#>to agree that some level of interference is necessary.\\n#\\n#They see the need for a \"justice\" system.  How can we even define that term?\\n\\nOnly by consensus, I guess.\\n\\n#  Thus you\\n#>get a situation where \"The law often allows what honour forbids\", which I\\'ve\\n#>come to believe is as it should be.  \\n#\\n#I admit I don\\'t understand that statement.\\n\\nWhat I mean is that, while thus-and-such may be legal, thus-and-such may\\nalso be seen as immoral.   The law lets you do it, but you don\\'t let yourself\\ndo it.

While most\\n  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the \\n  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area\\n  of jobs creation.\\n\\n  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,\\n  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed\\n  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting\\n  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.\\n\\n  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.\\n  \"It\\'s the guns\" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other\\n  \"gun-nuts\" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the\\n  economy out of the recession.  \"Their buying them five times faster than\\n  ever before, and stockpiling left and right\", the Vice President said.  \\n\\n  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have\\n  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several\\n  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have\\n  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.\\n\\n  \"We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people\", said\\n  the President of Colt industries.  \"As long as Clinton is in office, we\\n  suspect it will\", he added.\\n\\n  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new\\n  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It\\'s \\n  called the \"Ban-One-A-Month\" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,\\n  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index \\n  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw\\n  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any\\n  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the\\n  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.\\n\\n  The President said, \"This law will benefit America two ways.  When the\\n  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run\\n  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,\\n  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the\\n  street.\"  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee\\n  this program, citing her \"Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject\\n  of gun control\".\\n\\n  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an\\n  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing\\n  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  \"Their stockpiling,\\n  stockpiling, stockpiling\" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference\\n  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.\\n\\n  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment\\n  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been\\n  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, \"First we\\'ll\\n  fuck em, then we\\'ll kick em out of bed in the morning\", during a press\\n  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate\\n  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow\\n  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require\\n  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,\\n  after all of the cards have been drawn.\\n\\n  The head of the BATF responded by saying, \"We will have to see if this\\n  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those\\n  guns\".\\n\\n  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado\\n  declared this proposed law as being \"reasonable gun control which won\\'t\\n  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns\".\\n\\n  - end article -\\n\\n  For the humor impaired :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-)  :-) \\n\\n                                Bill Vojak\\n                                vojak@icebucket.stortek.com\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNRA, ILA,\\n                                Colorado Firearms Coalition\\n------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe CBS Nightly Propaganda With Dan Rather.

Or Darrell\\n>Evans! Yeah, yeah! After the Hall of Fame takes in them, it can take in\\n>Eddie Murray and Jeff Reardon.\\n\\n\\tOh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn\\'t hit a lick, had\\nnegligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,\\nnow entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent\\nhitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,\\nhe had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don\\'t \\nknow where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are\\nsimilar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn\\'t field,\\nhe ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his\\nOBP wasn\\'t THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)\\nwas a absolute-primo-dick.  \\n\\tEddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80\\'s.  I know that\\nMVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the\\nMVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn\\'t overrated by the media.  \\n\\tLee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one\\'s actually pretty close.  He\\'s had a s\\nsolid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks \\n(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I\\'d have to take a closer look at the stats (it\\'s been \\na while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  \\n\\tYou do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,\\nsimply racking up a lot of saves doesn\\'t mean a whole hell of a lot if you \\nblow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)\\nAtlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, \\nthe Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should \\nHomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.\\n\\tDarrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like\\nTed Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF\\'er.\\n\\n>     Well, in any case, I am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody\\n>giving Hall of Fame consideration to players that are by today\\'s standards,\\n>marginal.\\n\\n\\tLemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN\\'T marginal?\\n\\n>Honestly, Ozzie Smith and Robin Yount don\\'t belong there. They\\'re both\\n>shortstops that just hung around for a long time. Big deal.\\n>Let\\'s be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors so\\n>liberally. Save them for the guys who really deserve it. Face it, if something\\n\\n\\tNow, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the\\nposition of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he\\'s won something along\\nthe lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a \\ngood argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie\\'s more\\nrecent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early\\n80\\'s getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie\\'s\\noffense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his\\ncareer, depressed offense, admittedly, no power (\\'cept against Tom Niedenfuer\\n:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.\\n\\tYount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real\\nstiff.  His \\'82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,\\nand probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as\\nSS numbers go.  He\\'s a clear HOF\\'er, IMHO.\\n\\n>isn\\'t done, there will be little prestige in the Hall of Fame anymore. When \\n>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential \\n>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to\\n>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?\\n\\n\\tWell, as far as Garvey goes, you\\'re right.  Garvey is a \"mediot\" \\ncandidate, pushed because of his \"winning attitude\" (a minor factor, if one\\nat all), and his \"great defense\" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of\\na tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn\\'t be in the HOF.\\n\\tSkyJack?  I\\'ve said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last\\nyear or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk\\nabout Morris\\' \"ability to win\" which is nothing more than Morris\\' \"ability\\nto pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs\".  At this point, Morris is an\\naverage pitcher (although from his early returns in \\'93, he may be damned \\nclose to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the\\n80\\'s for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year\\nfor Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but\\nnot favorites.  Morris\\' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF\\n\"consideration\".  \\n\\tRyan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will\\nthrow back your earlier logic about \"Yount and Smith being shortstops who \\nhung around a long time\".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he\\'s \\njust pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...\\n(Of course, Nolan\\'s a HOF\\'er...)\\n\\tPuck?  Probably, although he\\'s got to play reasonably well for a few\\nmore years (10 years, even good ones, aren\\'t enough to make the HOF, most\\nlikely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much\\nregardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY \\ntragic or sudden).  He\\'s very popular in the media and with fans, and\\nlegitimately has been one of the best CF\\'s in the game since he joined the\\nleague.  I\\'ve always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the\\nend, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it\\'s too early to sell.\\n\\n\\tThis debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it \\nor not, I never tire of it.  It\\'s an interesting subject.  Here\\'s an off\\nthe top of my head list of potential HOF\\'ers from each team.  I probably\\nleft a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.

The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\\nended at about 6:30.\\n-- \\n\\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\\' Packet...\\n\\n',\n",

If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.

The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%.

Close and widen the stance,\\nand severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this\\nwill cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move\\nthe bathead more freely.\\n\\nSecond, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.\\n\\nThird, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find\\nmy 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling\\nthe wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength\\n is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of\\nthe park.\\n\\nIf Canseco\\'s open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back\\nproblems, he\\'ll be out of baseball in three years.

In terms of\\nsports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he\\ninterjects humor and politics into his show.\\n10 AM to 12 Noon:\\n  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their\\nabilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the\\nadvantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller\\nwho is asking about who the local team is going to draft\\nin the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get\\nbetter interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that\\nthey were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless\\nit was a major story.\\n  I would consider this even because they are two different\\nstyles of host.\\n\\n12 Noon to 2 PM:\\n  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to \\nJody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been\\non for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability\\nto transcend the \"homer\" mentality of the Philadelphia fan\\nbase.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia \\nspelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.\\nWhere else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0\\nscore without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning \\'guys\\')\\nI do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight\\nand I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating\\nhosts.

Mike and the dog are very entertaining,\\nbut they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10\\nto 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do\\nget great guests and that is the basis for their show, so\\nit is like the 10 to 12 debate.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don\\'t forget to\\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\\n\\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\\nanything that\\'s free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you\\'d like to\\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\\n\\n\\n[7]  What\\'s all this hoopla about color quantization?\\n\\nMost people don\\'t have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

Are you\\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\\nread\\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I\\'ll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won\\'t. \\n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\\n  cities in the Sixties.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn\\'t take long at all to\\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\\n  guns.\\n\\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \\'67\\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\\nbeen *big* news.\\n\\nAwesley goes on:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nAnd on:\\n  I don\\'t\\n  expect to convince you; you\\'ll have to open your mind and eyes and\\nactually\\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\\n  what you find.\\n\\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\\n\\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\n--John L. Scott\\n',\n",

       " 'From: rws@cs.arizona.edu (Ronald W. Schmidt)\\nSubject: outlining of spline surface\\nKeywords: spline rasterization\\nLines: 38\\n\\n\\n\\tAbout a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.\\nThey involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting\\nfrom the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem\\nsounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this\\narea.\\n\\n-Thanks\\n',\n",

Vonnegut succeeded Isaac Asimov as the \\n(honorary?) head of the American Humanist Association. (Vonnegut is\\nan atheist, and so was Asimov) Before Asimov\\'s funeral, Vonnegut stood up\\nand said about Asimov, \"He\\'s in heaven now,\" which ignited uproarious \\nlaughter in the room. (from the people he was speaking to around the time\\nof the funeral)\\n\\n\\t \"It\\'s the funniest thing I could have possibly said\\nto a room full of humanists,\" Vonnegut said at yesterday\\'s lecture. \\n\\n         If Vonnegut comes to speak at your university, I highly recommend\\ngoing to see him even if you\\'ve never read any of his novels.

If so, just how \\'open\\' does it\\nhave to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What\\nif one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,\\nis there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,\\nperiod? \\n\\nQuestion #2\\n\\nAs I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.\\nIs there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if\\nyou were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting\\nin your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending \\ntrial for the shooting?\\nAlso, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled\\nshotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, \\neither that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  \\nOne more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being\\nrich or famous or related to the mayor?\\n\\nPlease send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g\\na little faster than I can handle.

What exactly did I claim?\\n     --------------------------------------------------\\n    \"I\\'ve heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns\\n  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.\"\\n     --------------------------------------------------\\n  \\n    I wasn\\'t wrong . . . I\\'ve heard those descriptions.  If you\\'re\\n  paying attention, I\\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\\n  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\\n  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\\n  \"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\\n  \\nLater in the same post:\\n     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\n  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\\n  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\\n\\nFine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are\\n\"inclined\" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those\\nclaims are still ludicrous, however.\\n\\nPreviously Awesley had written:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nPrompting me to write:\\n  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\n  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\n  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\n  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nTo which Awesley replied:\\n  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you\\n  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\\n  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\\n  need some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a\\n  while.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here.\\n\\nBut why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the\\nnotion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion\\nbecause it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But\\nthat too is ludicrous.\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\n  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\n  it. \\n\\nAwesley relied:\\n     Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\n  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\n  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\n  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\n  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\n  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\n  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\n  heard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\n  assert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\nYes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. \\nArmy tanks don\\'t fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960\\'s\\nwithout it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on\\nit and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying\\n\"this has gone far enough.\"  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis\\nfor my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. \\nNot one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and\\neverybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it\\nhad happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own\\nresearch failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is\\nextraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. \\nUnless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I\\ndo not.\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\nAwesley wrote:\\n     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\n  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\n  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\n  So it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\nQuibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has\\ntaught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half\\ndecades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said \"yes, I\\nshelled Americans,\" or \"I gave the orders to fire the cannons,\" or \"I\\nhelped cover it up\"?\\n\\nI wrote:\\n  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I\\nprefer\\n  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\n  that they did fire their guns.\\n\\nGood.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. \\nYour belief fails a basic reality check: why isn\\'t it known?\\n\\nAwesley concludes:\\n     Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\n  this far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\n  account I cited.\\n\\nActually, now we have established that I don\\'t believe what you believe, as\\nwell as why I don\\'t believe it.  And if it\\'s boring, then I yield the last\\nword to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with\\nimpunity--I am dropping the subject.\\n\\n--John L. Scott\\n',\n",

(818) 354-5011\\n\\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\\n\\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\\n#1506\\n\\n     Scientists at NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth\\'s ozone layer.\\n\\n     The April 3 flight from California\\'s Barstow/Daggett Airport\\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \\n\\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\\nDiscovery.\\n\\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.                        \\n\\n                              #####\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps \\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation \\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation\\n                                                  | instead.\\n',\n",

It\\'s one\\nof those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.\\nWhat Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I\\'m sure, is that when people\\nread this they think violent arguments where one member of the family\\ngrabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation\\nwhich could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or\\na tragic accident, especially involving a child.\\n\\n       Unfortunately, that\\'s not the way things stack up.  The majority\\nof that 43 \"times\" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone \\nintentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill \\nthemselves.  And why it\\'s popular to try and blame suicides on guns,\\nthe evidence doesn\\'t support this.  Internal studies, as well as\\ncomparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural\\nfactors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.\\n(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There\\npeople jump off buildings.)\\n\\n       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime\\nis commited by \"non-strangers,\" which mistakenly has been generalized\\nregarding the King County study to mean, \"Friends and family.\"  That\\nis, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on\\nthe mental image that a \"Friend, family member, or child,\" equates\\nto a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of\\nanger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,\\nchildren assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by \\nsomeone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun\\nwas used against a \"friend\" or family member doesn\\'t mean they\\nweren\\'t trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among\\npoor urban families, and those are also the areas most \"at risk\"\\nfor family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may\\nnot be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban\\nkid might.\\n\\n       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the\\nonly value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I\\nworked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly\\nself-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.\\nBetween the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there\\'s an enormous\\namount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.\\nAs such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid\\nmeans of determining the success of such a defense, since according\\nto the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report\\ndefenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders\\nkilled.\\n\\n       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a \"friend\\nor family member\" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense\\nwhich occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in\\nbusinesses.)\\n\\n>Studies by the \\n>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence\\n>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member\\n>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.\"\\n\\n       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can\\'t comment.  I\\nwill point out Canada\\'s and Japan\\'s suicide rate as indications that\\nculture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.\\n\\n       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what\\nit\\'s worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural\\nlines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the\\nexact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws \\nwould not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has \\n          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in \\n          his first book \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE\". \\n    \\n               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, \\n          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call \\n          \"science\" (or \"physics\", or \"astronomy\", etc.), as well as \\n          the \"scientific\" literature and the \"education\" systems, to \\n          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson\\'s Theory has they have. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory has excellent explanations for many \\n          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such \\n          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY \\n          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, \\n          in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Notwithstanding the military\\n    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are\\n    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments\\n    are afraid to trust the people with arms.\"\\n                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: \"The right\\n    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A\\n    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\\n                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free\\n    country...\"\\n\\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of\\n    the militia): \"Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with\\n    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\\n    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\\n    a year.\"\\n\\n    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing\\n    armies): \"... if circumstances should at any time oblige the\\n    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be\\n    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large\\n    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in\\n    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their\\n                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****\\n    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.\"\\n    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBut *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn\\'t mean the PEOPLE when they\\nsaid \"people\", right?

That\\'s why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that\\nwas to insure the People could form a \"well regulated Militia\", not a\\n\"well organized militia\".\\n\\n> It could be\\n> argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last \\n> part.

He\\nonly wrote it.\\n\\n> The amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with \\n> the security of a free state.  The Federalist Paper\\'s mention of a\\n> well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects\\n> the security of a free state.

Show me where the document says \"well organized\\nmilitia\". \\n\\n> Lastly, reading through the Federalist Paper\\'s on well organized \\n> militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias.\\n> One reason stated is the protection from a standing army.

A gun kills people.  \\n\\nRather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is\\ngood, or at least, better than the alternative.\\n\\n>But let\\'s ignore guns for defence and/or crime and look at gun accidents.\\n\\nOk.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the\\nnumber has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these\\naccidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.\\n\\n...\\n>But seriously: a gun is designed to fire a bullet.   This is not so you\\n>can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range.\\n\\nIn fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. \\nThe idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber\\nhandgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,\\nwould, I\\'m sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn\\'t\\nwhy I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,\\nand might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to\\nkill people.\\n\\n>This is not designed to act as a tool for home  defence where you show\\n>someone  that you have a gun and they go \"Gee, perhaps I should leave\".\\n\\nIn fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses\\nof firearms don\\'t involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer\\nnot to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what\\nyou say when you point a gun at them.\\n\\nIf you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to\\nimmediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is\\nabout the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work\\nthe best.[3]\\n\\n>No, you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human\\n>body and hurt them.  Not a tough concept to swallow, for most.\\n\\nCertainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)\\naren\\'t deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn\\'t true to say that all of\\nthem were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with\\nhaving deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to\\nuse deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,\\nbut my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and\\nknowing how to use the tools to do that.\\n\\n\"The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear\\narms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in\\ngovernment.\"\\n\\t- T. Jefferson.\\n\\nI think what Jefferson said is still true.\\n\\n>And the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes\\n>off into the wrong fleshy target.\\n\\nNot very often compared to other use.[3]\\n\\n>Or else Uncle Frank gets pissed and blows  away his wife.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is\\nvery rare that a non-violent person will suddenly \"get-pissed\" and kill\\nsomeone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long\\nhistories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these\\npeople wouldn\\'t kill if they didn\\'t have a gun, feel free to present it.\\n\\n>Having a thing  specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to\\n>kill things.  Right?\\n\\nRight, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I\\nnever have to shoot a person, but I\\'ve had to kill a number of animals from\\nrodents to cows, and when I do, I don\\'t want them to suffer any more than\\nis necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them\\nto drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,\\nI don\\'t want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and\\nammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I\\'m\\nafter, but it doesn\\'t always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,\\npeople who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,\\nparticularly handguns, haven\\'t used them much for that purpose.\\n\\n\\n[1] Accidental deaths in 1988:\\n\\t48700 deaths by auto\\n\\t11300 deaths by fall\\n\\t 5300 deaths by drowning\\n\\t 4800 deaths by fire\\n\\t 4400 deaths by poison\\n\\t 3200 deaths by food\\n\\t 1400 deaths by firearm\\n\\n     Source: Statistics Department, National Safety Council.\\n     \"Accidents Facts 1988 Edition\".

That is, the\\nability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise\\nfrom the government\\'s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations\\nfor behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,\\nwhich is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get\\npast legally, since it wouldn\\'t be based on making regulations on public\\nproperty, but in restricting activity on private property.              \\n\\n>Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):\\n>Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners \\'arms\\'\\n>for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.\\n>Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short \\n>time befor the crime.\\n>\\n>Use of knives:\\n>It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or \\'open\\'.\\n>You (Americans) think it\\'s ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open\\n>in public -rigth ??\\n\\n        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have\\na difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,\\nwhere the laws from one state to another can be as radically different\\nas from one country in Europe to another).\\n\\n        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow\\nconcealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can\\nbe either a state or local restriciton.       \\n\\n>Individual vs masses:\\n>Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some\\n>extent....\\n>Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??\\n>What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of \\n>all the others ??\\n\\n       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual\\naffecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually\\nget is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within\\nthis group, here defined as \"people who own guns,\") are adversely affecting \\nthe rights of some other group.  \\n\\n       If for instance, \"Bob\" were using his gun to attack \"Steve,\" you\\'d\\nhave a point.

It\\'s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited\\nby one.\\n\\n>The issue:\\n>I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.\\n\\n       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to\\nwhat extent guns and gun legislation impact those.\\n\\n>We shouldn\\'t mix weapons and items that can serve as one....\\n>IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.\\n>But should it have to be like that ??\\n\\n       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn\\'t have to fear that\\nother people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.\\nBut currently we don\\'t have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.\\n\\n>Do you think it\\'s wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??\\n\\n       No state does.  In any case, there\\'s a limit to which the state\\nmay enforce it\\'s \"wisdom\" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise\\nconcept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be\\n\"unwise\" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.\\n   \\n>If you believe it\\'s smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think\\n>it should be free to buy guns ??\\n\\n       I\\'ll raise my hand against driver\\'s licenses.  As currently\\nimplemented they\\'re a waste of time and little more than revanue\\ngeneration for the State and ignored by a startling number of\\ndrivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is\\nnecessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody\\nelse killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year\\nold will have picked up riding around in his parents car.\\n\\n       But, as I mentioned, they\\'re two different things.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid Veal Univ. of Tenn.

Both spacecraft will team up with\\nground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create\\na radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio\\ntelescope observing power by a factor of 10.\\n     Japan\\'s VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to\\nconduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft\\nwill exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory\\nradio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for\\nroughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio\\ntelescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object\\nwhile within view on Earth.\\n     According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL\\'s project manager for the\\nU.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit\\nJapan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio\\ninterferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio\\nastronomy communities that will be vital during the complex\\nobservations required by the Space VLBI project.\\n     \"One of our main activities is developing the methodology\\nfor international coordination, because the two spacecraft\\nsimultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while\\nusing the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same\\ncelestial objects,\" said Smith.\\n     Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN\\nfacilities and other three other tracking facilities located in\\nJapan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of\\nground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and\\nhigh-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the\\ninformation to a correlator located at the National Radio\\nAstronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will\\ncombine and process data, then make it available to mission\\ninvestigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail.\\n     Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created\\nby the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with\\nbetter resolution than has ever been achieved before by\\nground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a\\ncloser look at distant objects in space.\\n     \"There is a long history of radio astronomy using\\nground-based telescopes,\" said Smith. \"What we intend to do is to\\nextend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look\\ndeeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other\\nactive radio sources to understand what drives those things we\\nhave seen so far with radio astronomy.\"\\n     Smith noted that if one examines \"the active galactic\\nnuclei, you\\'ll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than\\nlight, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater\\nthan you would expect.\"\\n     He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be\\nlocated in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel\\nthe jets. Smith hopes that \"by using Space VLBI to look further\\ninto the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved.\"\\n     Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and\\ntransmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and\\nJapanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this\\nyear. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and\\nengineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA\\nCorrelator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd\\ndata patterns that will originate from the more than 20\\nground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI.\\n     Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the\\nJapanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at\\nJPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the\\npolitical uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country\\'s\\nparticipation in the project.\\n     \"Nothing is ever smooth,\" he said, \"but the Russians have\\nbeen incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some\\nlikelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors\\nbeyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these\\nthings going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard,\\nand people recognize the value of cooperation at this level.\"\\n     Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at\\nstake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a\\nscience mission.\\n     \"The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since\\ninternational cooperation is essential to their science mission,\"\\nhe said.\\n     But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials\\nlook at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase\\nthe technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly\\nregarded Mach V launch vehicle.\\n     Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an\\nambitious project, JPL\\'s Smith is satisfied that planning for the\\nSpace VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and\\npolitical hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project.\\n     \"Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and\\nif either falls out, we would still have something with the\\nother. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent,\\nscientifically exciting missions.\"\\n                           ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.\\n-- \\nC.

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands\\nMissile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government\\nagencies.\\n\\n        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for\\norbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent\\nchanges in SDI\\'s political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO\\nless of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as\\na step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,\\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\'s deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell\\nDouglas Astronautics headquarters.\\n\\n        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program\\'s orbital\\nobjective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes\\nthis philosophy can produce breakthroughs that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology developments.\\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --\\nshowed how today\\'s engineers could move beyond the \"miracles of our\\nparents\\' time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key is management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\'s essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goes up exponentially.\"\\n\\n        SDIO\\'s approach also won praise from two California members of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"This is the direction\\nwe\\'re going to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\'s\\nDemocratic chairman. \"Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learned it yet.  SDIO has.\"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\'s Republican colleague, went further.\\nJoking that \"a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell\\nDouglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged\\nrockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. \"Let\\'s not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let\\'s build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO\\'s sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its\\nC-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious\\nabout a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large ventures,\\ncompanies put in seed money,\" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas\\'\\nsenior vice president for space systems. \"You need strong government\\ninvestments.\"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding\\nfor the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas\\nAircraft\\'s DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The\\nfirst tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle\\ntake-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntests will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotates the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.\\n\\n        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.\\nNow a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles\\naircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated\\ncheck-out and access panels for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model\\nhas a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.\\n\\n        The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.

       " \"From: ndallen@r-node.hub.org (Nigel Allen)\\nSubject: WACO: Clinton press conference, part 1\\nOrganization: R-node Public Access Unix - 1 416 249 5366\\nLines: 282\\n\\nHere is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \\nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\\n\\n1:36 P.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\\n\\n   (more, more)\\n -30-\\n\",\n",

In addition, many stand alone\\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\\n\\n\\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\\n\\n\\tEndeavour\\'s June flight and Discovery\\'s July mission both will include\\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\\nHuntsville, Ala.\\n\\n\\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\\ntrainers.\\n\\n\\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\\n\\n\\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\\nbecome necessary.\\n\\n- end -\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\\n    public and university library.

It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\nmaterials we can\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\nand it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat \\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor \\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\n\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the\\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\\ncenturies, if not much longer.\\n\\nLuna\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site\\nof a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for\\ndefending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again.

In fact,\\n>it doesn\\'t mean *anything*, because the units are screwy.\\n\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n>Consider an example:  Bob hits a 2-out solo HR in the bottom of the first;\\n>about .12 on your scale.  He does the same thing again in the fourth, with\\n>the score tied, for another .14.  And again, in the seventh, with the score\\n>tied, for another .22.  And, finally, in the ninth to win the game by a score\\n>of 7-6, for a value of 0.5.  Bob hit 4 solo HR in 4 plate appearances, and\\n>was credited by your method with .12 + .14 + .22 + .5 = .98.  But what does\\n>that mean?  Was Bob 98% responsible for the win?  Certainly not; the defense\\n>is *always* 50% responsible (if you include pitching in that), and Bob wasn\\'t\\n>pitching.  In fact, Bob was only 4/7 of the offense (which is a lot, but not\\n>even close to 100%).  Furthermore, what about the other 3 team runs?  Say\\n>they all came on solo HR by Fred; then Fred was hitting HR to tie up the game,\\n>which are just as valuable as HR to take the lead (see Lindsey), and Fred will\\n>himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so.  So Fred and Bob combined have\\n>amassed 138% of a win IN ONE GAME.  There\\'s clearly a problem here.\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n>>Greg thinking about the right things, but his intuition is off the\\n>>mark.  Closers are enormously important.  The total number of runs\\n>>value is outweighed by when they come, or are prevented from comming.\\n>>The doubling which Greg allows is not enough.\\n>\\n>In another article, I proposed a test of this.  We can predict a team\\'s \\n>won/lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs *total* they\\n>score and allow, without regard to when those runs score in the game.  If\\n>late runs are really more important than early runs, then looking only at\\n>late runs should lead to a *better* predictor, right?\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n>Here\\'s another thought experiment: apply this method to basketball.  What\\n>you find is that points scored in the first *half* of the game have almost\\n>exactly no value, because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.\\n>Furthermore, the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with\\n>no time on the clock gets a +1.0 for the game, while the star forward who \\n>scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.\\n>\\n>Does this make sense?\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.\\n\\n                                                        Brian Smith\\n',\n",

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE\\n    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly\\n    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or\\n    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming\\n    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.\\n\\n    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news\\n    frequently.\\n\\n\\n    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?\\n\\n    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks\\n    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).\\n\\n    The \"Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,\" ASC G&C 2102,\\n    says:\\n\\n\\t\"During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is\\n\\tcommanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower\\n\\tclearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press\\n    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle\\n    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying\\n    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions\\n    are not being covered.\\n\\n\\n    AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS\\n\\n    The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:\\n\\n\\tW6FXN  - Los Angeles\\n\\tK6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California\\n\\tWA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.\\n\\tW5RRR  - Johnson Space Center (JSC), Houston, Texas\\n\\tW6VIO  - Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), Pasadena, California.\\n\\tW1AW Voice Bulletins\\n\\n\\tStation    VHF\\t   10m\\t   15m\\t   20m\\t  40m\\t 80m\\n\\t------\\t ------  ------  ------  ------  -----\\t-----\\n\\tW6FXN\\t 145.46\\n\\tK6MF\\t 145.585\\t\\t\\t 7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tWA3NAN\\t 147.45  28.650  21.395  14.295  7.185\\t3.860\\n\\tW5RRR\\t 146.64  28.400  21.350  14.280  7.227\\t3.850\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.340  14.270\\n\\tW6VIO\\t 224.04\\t\\t 21.280  14.282  7.165\\t3.840\\n\\tW1AW\\t\\t 28.590  21.390  14.290  7.290\\t3.990\\n\\n    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the\\n    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.\\n\\n    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160.

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it\\'s M-16 now to\\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\\n\\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\\n\\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\\n  the trigger again.\\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n  to rotate to the next round.\\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n  easy motion, even one handed.\\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n  about clearing it.\\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \\n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\\n  of employment as a revolver.\\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\\n\\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\\nas the timer on a VCR.\\n\\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\\nthe police don\\'t know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid.

But thanks\\nto major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL\\'s\\nSpace Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project\\nconsidered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is \"alive\\nand well,\" according to Project Scientist Michael Werner.\\n     A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have\\nadded up to a less expensive project with \"tremendous scientific\\npower\" and a bright future, said Werner.\\n     Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared\\nAstronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer\\n(COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for\\ninfrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000\\nor 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled.\\n     IRAS\\' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10\\nyears ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never\\nbefore and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25\\ncomets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than\\nany previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has\\nmeasured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large\\nangular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe.\\n     But to illuminate SIRTF\\'s potential, Jim Evans, JPL\\'s\\nmanager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects,\\nrecently said that the project is \"1,000 to 1 million times more\\ncapable than IRAS,\" based on technological advances in infrared\\ndetector arrays.\\n     However, despite the enormous strides in infrared\\nexploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the\\nhighest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s\\n(by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a \"diet or die\"\\ndirective from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project\\ngoing, according to Werner.\\n     The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key\\nfactor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun\\ninstead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket\\nlaunch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. \"The\\nmain advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your\\nlaunch capability for boosting the payload -- you don\\'t have to\\ncarry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,\" Werner said.\\nThe other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that \"it\\'s in a\\nbetter thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth.\"\\n     Additional major changes in SIRTF\\'s redesign include\\nshortening the mission from five to three years and building a\\nspacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original\\nplan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds)\\ncompared to Titan SIRTF\\'s 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds).\\n     All of that adds up to \"a less stressful launch\\nenvironment,\" Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200\\nmillion for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the\\ndesign of the smaller, less massive spacecraft.\\n     Werner said SIRTF\\'s redesign came as a result of Congress\\'\\ntelling NASA \"you\\'re trying to do too many things. If you want us\\nto support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see\\nhow it fits into (NASA\\'s) overall strategy.\"\\n     Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA\\'s highest\\npriority \"flagship\" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary\\nSpace Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing\\nfrom the National Academy of Sciences.\\n     While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping\\nto keep the project alive, SIRTF\\'s major scientific contribution\\nalways promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector\\narrays, which will allow images to be developed \"tens of\\nthousands of times faster\" than before, according to Evans.\\n     \"Up until a couple of years ago,\" Werner said, \"all infrared\\nastronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays\\nof individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department\\nof Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or\\nhundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and\\nthose are very well suited for use on SIRTF.\"\\n     Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget\\npressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an\\neye out for any \"technological spinoff.\"\\n     \"On that question, I think we have some things to say,\" he\\nsaid, \"because the detectors we\\'re using are straight off various\\nmilitary developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S.\\naerospace industry, and it\\'s a real technological and engineering\\nchallenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project.\\n     \"SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,\"\\nWerner added, but the revised three-year mission \"puts a premium\\non observing time. We have to educate the user community and\\ndevelop a program that involves early surveys and quick\\nturnaround of the data.\"\\n     Werner said the downsizing of the project required a\\nreduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF\\'s three instruments --\\nthe infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband\\nimaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in\\nlosses of efficiency rather than capability, he said.\\n     The project hopes to start a \"Phase B\" activity in 1995,\\nwhich will provide a detailed concept for development and design.\\nBuilding the hardware would begin about two years later.\\n     Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950\\nmillion.\\n     \"I am very optimistic about SIRTF,\" he said. \"It will\\nprovide a tremendous return for the investment.\"\\n     Werner added that an additional benefit from the project\\nwill be the \"enrichment of our intellectual and cultural\\nenvironment. People on the street are very interested in\\nastronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other\\nplanets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of\\nquestions SIRTF will help answer.\"\\n                              ###\\n     ___    _____     ___\\n    /_ /|  /____/ \\\\  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov\\n    | | | |  __ \\\\ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab |\\n ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand\\n/___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and\\n|_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.\\n\\n',\n",

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle\\nor pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And \"snipers\"\\ntoo often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.\\n\\nI don\\'t know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but\\nthe idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that\\npretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them\\nin the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...\\n\\nAnd these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things\\nso that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are\\nthan expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn\\'t\\nPROGRESSIVE or doesn\\'t fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...\\n\\nUnbelievable.\\n\\nAnd I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,\\nthat it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun\\ninto a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".  I think it could be\\ndone and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is\\nnot like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning\\nand firing, you know.

That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n> \\n>> The death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime,  but the legal\\n>> shenanigans that have been added (automatic appeals, lengthy court\\n>> battles, etc.) have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what\\n>> it should be.

I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\\n       \\nRegards,\\n\\nJim B.\\n',\n",

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tJohn.\\n\",\n",

But Bo, despite his speed, \\nhit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his\\nvalue to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  \\n\\n> That is good.

I thought he\\nwas always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so \\nat baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn\\'t\\nwinning.\\n\\nNote 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a\\nmistake being made (by the SDCN\\'s, as they are known, on this group)\\nwith respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).\\n\\nWe find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major\\nand minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.\\nTheir are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;\\nthe lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent\\nthe player has left college ball, etc.\\n\\nNow of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of \"error.\"  Sometimes\\na player with poor MLE\\'s (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.\\nSome hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don\\'t (Oddibe\\nMcDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are\\nreal reasons why Oddibe didn\\'t hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)\\ninvolve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting\\nand so on.\\n\\nBut still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.\\nOne of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background\\nof the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is\\nthat all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing\\nball.  Their backgrounds are similar.\\n\\nWhat hasn\\'t been established is what happens when you encounter a player\\nwith a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a\\nBo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so\\non, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard\\nassumptions fit this person slowly?\\n\\nIt hasn\\'t been established that you can use MLE\\'s with two-sport players.\\n(It hasn\\'t been established that you can\\'t, but then statistics is, after\\nall, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually\\nmake completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.\\n\"Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,\" they say.  Well,\\nwhat happens if those numbers simply don\\'t mean what they usually mean?\\nIt might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than\\nTuscon.

Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",

The way they were used at\\nthat time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one\\nof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of\\nthe Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched\\na complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It\\nwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the\\nyear for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.\\nAlso notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1\\nthrough October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than\\nthe other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that\\nstretch.\\n\\n-----\\nEric Smith\\nerics@netcom.com\\nerics@infoserv.com\\nCI$: 70262,3610\\n\",\n",

       " 'From: renew@blade.stack.urc.tue.nl (Rene Walter)\\nSubject: CView answers\\nOrganization: MCGV Stack, Eindhoven University of Technology, the Netherlands.\\nLines: 66\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: blade.stack.urc.tue.nl\\nSummary: some CView problems explained\\nKeywords: Stupid Programming\\nX-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]\\n\\nA very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.\\nSince he isn\\'t in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post\\nit for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:\\n\\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\\ndoesn\\'t check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \\nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\\n\\n The result of this process is the following:\\n  \\n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren\\'t performed.\\n\\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\\n        there was room on the disk.\\n\\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG\\'s (1200x900 and bigger) can be\\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\\n\\n\\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\\ntable? I can\\'t remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\\nsort a directory listing?\\n\\n\\nWith much thanks to the originator of this article.\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n |        Rene Walter          |          renew@stack.urc.tue.nl           |\\n +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+\\n | \"Will I drown in tears of sorrow, Is there hope for tomorrow,           |\\n |  Will this world ever get better, Can\\'t we all just live together       |\\n |  I don\\'t wanna live in strife  , I just wanna live my life              |\\n |  I deserve to have a future...\"                                         |\\n |                                     -The Good Girls    \"Future\"         |\\n +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+\\n\\n',\n",
